🎯 Number Guessing Game
🧠 A fun and simple Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100!

💡 How it works:
The program uses Python’s built-in random module to generate a random number.

The player is prompted to guess until they find the correct number.

After each guess, the program gives hints:

🔽 “Lower number please” if the guess is too high

🔼 “Higher number please” if the guess is too low

It counts the total number of attempts and displays it once the user wins.

🛠️ Concepts used:
Loops (while)

Conditionals (if-else)

User input

Random number generation
